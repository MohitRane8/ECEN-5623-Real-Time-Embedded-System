Project: Automation of cars is the ambition of the present and the necessity of the future. Smart cars are steering a wave in the automobile industry. In context of this, we aim to design a prototype which will detect the lane the car is currently present in. Lane detection concept is being implemented through real-time processing of the video capture.
